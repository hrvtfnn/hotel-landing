# Hotel Landing page 🥰
I designed a landing page for Puszta Wellness Hotel to promote their Christmas package.
The expectation was for the page to include:
- Highlighting the hotel's name and logo along with the main details of the package,
- a Christmas-themed image,
- a Booking button,
- a newsletter subscription form.

# What I learned 🪄
I had some issues with the relationship between the hero image and the hero container, and it was challenging for me to figure out how to position them correctly. 🎉

# To Do List for the future ✏️
- [x] Update the typography
